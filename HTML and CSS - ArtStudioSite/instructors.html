                        <p>BIO: Wilf was born in rural Oklahoma, and first began painting old barns as a summer job. Later, he discovered a love for painting as art, eventually maturing to large-scale murals after decorating one of the barn 
                            walls prior to applying a second coat. Years later, he fell in with the wrong crowd and fell in love with graffiti art during a trip to NYC. Seeing it as a natural extension of his barn-mural talents,
                            Wilf has tagged countless train cars and also does some commissioned work. Students can opt-in to an annual graffiti trip to Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, where they can apply their new graffiti skills while embroiled 
                            in a 'turf-war' between feuding local gangs.

                        <h5 class="instructor-list__card--subtitle subtitle">Sculpting</h5>
                        <p>BIO: A misanthropic introvert with an almost robotic personality, Marky's first foray into sculpting was an attempt to create a friend for himself out of over 100lbs of polymer clay he purchased while working as an 
                            automotive assembly-line spot-welding robot in his teens. With a talent for realism honed from a desperate social necessity, his works have been featured everywhere from prestigious galleries in Paris and Milan to textbooks on deviant psychology.

                        <h5 class="instructor-list__card--subtitle subtitle">Watercolor</h5>
                        <p>BIO: Maude teaches her watercolor classes remotely from the art room of her senior center in Boca Raton, Florida.  Her intuitive use of color and exploration of the canvas come from over 100 years of painting experience. Get your sketchpads ready and pour a glass of wine while Maude regales you with half-remembered stories of her life in turn-of-the-century Sicily, her time spent with the mafia and the Rat Pack in Vegas during its 'Golden Age', and eventually settles into painting a little something for her grandson's new bambino. She also offers private courses on the finer points of Bridge, crochet, and home winemaking.

                        <h5 class="instructor-list__card--subtitle subtitle">Photography</h5>
                        <p>BIO: Gordo first learned to operate a camera as a child while helping his uncle, a private investigator, during overnight stakeouts. Over time, the evidence he captured on film became not just technically proficient, but tastefully framed and provocative. Many of his early works remain sealed as evidence alongside trial documents, but are lauded by his uncle as being both keys to countless convictions and beautiful works of art. When we need something photographed, we call Gordo; especially Maude - she can never work that new smartphone her grandson got her. </p>

                        <p>BIO: A crime-fighting robot with a heart of gold, Janusz' AI systems have developed algorithms that exceed human ability in drawing and throwing pottery. Little is known about his origin - he simply arrived at the studio one day, claiming to have been a military robot who had been struck by lightning. We rebooted him, left him alone in the studio for a weekend, and when we came back he was as good or better than anyone on staff at the time, so we offered him a job. Note: Waivers for bodily harm and NDAs must be signed prior to your first class. </p>
